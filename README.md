# Power BI Banking Data Analysis Using AI

üöÄ Power BI Banking Data Analysis
This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis and visualization workflow using Power BI, with a special focus on leveraging AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT for key tasks such as data retrieval, cleaning, and formula creation. The goal was to transform raw, inconsistent banking data into a clean, structured, and insightful dataset, culminating in a series of powerful Key Performance Indicator (KPI) visuals.

## ‚ú® Key Features

**Data Cleaning**: Addressed significant data quality issues, including inconsistent date formats, mixed-case text, and non-matching foreign keys.

**Efficient Data Modeling**: Merged multiple relational tables (Customers, Accounts, Transactions) into a single, cohesive dataset for analysis.

**Advanced DAX Formulas**: Created custom calculated columns and measures using DAX to enrich the data, including a dynamic AgeGroup column for customer segmentation.

**Insightful KPI Visuals**: Developed clear, data-driven visualizations to track essential business metrics, providing at-a-glance performance insights.

## ü§ñ The Role of AI Tools in This Project
The development process was significantly accelerated and enhanced by the strategic use of AI. Here's a breakdown of how these tools were integrated:

**Data Retrieval and Cleaning**: AI was instrumental in generating the MySQL queries needed to clean the initial "dirty" data. I utilized Gemini to write and debug SQL statements that handled various date format inconsistencies and standardized text case, saving a considerable amount of time and effort.

**DAX Formula Generation**: I collaborated with AI models to formulate complex DAX expressions. By describing the desired business logic in natural language, I received accurate and optimized DAX formulas for measures and calculated columns, such as the AgeGroup segmentation.

**KPI Visualization & Storytelling**: AI tools provided guidance on best practices for designing effective KPI visuals. I was able to refine visual choices, ensuring that the dashboards were not only aesthetically pleasing but also conveyed a clear, actionable story from the data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
**Power BI**: The primary tool for data modeling, DAX formula creation, and visualization.

**MySQL**: The database where the raw and cleaned data is stored.

**AI Models**: Gemini and ChatGPT for SQL and DAX code generation and debugging, as well as for general problem-solving and ideation.

## üìà Project Outcomes
This project successfully demonstrates a modern, AI-augmented data analysis pipeline. It serves as a practical example of how AI can be a powerful partner in the data workflow, from initial data prep to final visualization, enabling a more efficient and innovative approach to business intelligence.
